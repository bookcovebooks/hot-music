  "description": "When a society violinist’s jewels vanish from her locked apartment, radio police announcer Dave Cates seizes the chance to step beyond the microphone and into real detective work. What begins as a routine broadcast alert soon entangles him with glamorous musicians, wealthy patrons, and the coded rhythms of a city alive after dark. As syncopated jazz pulses through nightclubs and airwaves, Cates follows subtle clues hidden in music, manners, and motive. In a world where signals travel faster than truth, ambition and intrigue collide in a case that could change his future.",
